Scarlet Sage is native to Brazil, but is grown as ornamental plant all around the world. The native type grows in altitudes between 2000m and 3000m and can reach a height of up to 1.3m. In cultivation it usually grows much smaller, like this specimen in front of the north entry of the Zoologischer Stadtgarten in Karlsruhe.
