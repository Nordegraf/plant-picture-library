This variant of Zinnia elegans looks a bit different than the one observed in Karlsruhe.

Interestingly PlantNet identifies it at Zinnia peruviana with a confidence of roughly 60%. This is most certainly incorrect. First of all this plant was grown from a seed package listing it as Zinnia Liliput, which is a variant of Zinnia elegans. Secondly, if one compares images of <a class="plink" href="https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/181901-Zinnia-elegans/browse_photos?grouping=taxon_id">Zinnia elegans</a> and <a class="plink" href="https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/153439-Zinnia-peruviana/browse_photos?grouping=taxon_id">Zinnia peruviana</a>, one can see, that the flower stamen of Zinnia elegans are arranged in a circle around the center of the flower, while the stamen of Zinnia peruviana are much closer together in a cone-like shape. The flower of this plant clearly shows the former arrangement.
