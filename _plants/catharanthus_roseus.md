Cataranthus roseus was first included in the genus Vinca as Vinca rosea in 1759. in 1838 it was renamed to Lochnera rosea, but at the same time it was classfied as Cataranthus roseus. The latter name was given priority.

Cataranthus roseus is a source for vincristine and vinblastine, two alkaloids used in treatment of various types of cancer.
