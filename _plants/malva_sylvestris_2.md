This beautiful plant was found close to the Mosel river in Ürzig, Germany.
Given the juvenile state, it is hard to identify it with certainty, but it is most likely malva sylvestris L.. Another possibility would be malva arborea, but this species is much more common in coastal areas and grows taller with a wooden stem. Moreover it usually flowers from May to June (<a class="plink" href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baumförmige_Strauchpappel">german Wikipedia article</a>). In a more mature state, the plant could also be identified by checking for leaves at the stem. Malva arborea typically has no leaves at the stem, which distinguishes it from other species (<a class="plink" href="http://www.malvaceae.info/Genera/Lavatera/arborea.html">Source</a>).

The beautfiful dark purple colored flowers indicate, that this actually might be the variety malva sylvestris var. mauritiana (images on <a class="plink" href="https://www.gbif.org/species/6285889">GBIF</a> and <a class="plink" href="https://www.inaturalist.org/observations?place_id=any&taxon_id=359171">iNaturalist</a>). The location data of observations on <a class="plink" href="https://naturgucker.de/natur.dll/XbQJCUmO2brRnyfjTBF0R4JWBl8/">Naturgucker.de</a> also shows, that this variant has mostly been observed close to that area.
