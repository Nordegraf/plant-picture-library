This could also be identified as tagetes patula, which grows smaller than tagetes erecta. However tagetes patula is not recognized as an own species by some taxonomy authorities. The <a class="plink" href="https://www.itis.gov/servlet/SingleRpt/SingleRpt?search_topic=TSN&search_value=38488#null">ITIS database</a> for example lists it as a synonym for tagetes erecta.
