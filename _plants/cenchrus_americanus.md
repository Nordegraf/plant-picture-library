During my second stay at KAUST we went on a trip to the Masturah Dunes. Before driving into the dunes we stopped right next to a field with these plants to let some air out of the tires. They are most likely pearl millet, a crop grown in Africa and the Indian for food and fodder since prehistoric times. It is well adapted to arid regions and can grow in poor soils.

Because of this Pearl Millets have been grown on the Arabian Peninsula for a long time aswell and are being actively researched to increase their yield. During research I found these papers about <a class="plink" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/327795337_Conservation_of_genetic_resources_for_five_traditional_crops_from_Jazan_SW_Saudi_Arabia_at_the_KACST_Gene-Bank"> conservation of genetic resources</a> and a review on <a class="plink" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/372114124_A_Comprehensive_Review_of_Pearl_and_Small_Millets_Taxonomy_Production_Breeding_and_Future_Prospects_in_Saudi_Arabia">taxonomy, production, breeding and future prospects</a>.

Fun Fact: 2023 is the International Year of Millets.
