This picture was sent to me by Rebekka after a trip through the <a class="plink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rub%27_al_Khali">Rub' al Khali</a>, or Empty Quarter.

Identifying this flower was a bit tricky, as it looks similar to <a class="plink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribulus_terrestris">Tribulus terrestris</a>, which is what PlantNet suggested with a confidence value of only 12%. However the leaves of T. terrestris seem to be larger, more rounded and greener than those in the picture. <a class="plink" href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Tribulus_terrestris_(Family_Zygophyllaceae).jpg#/media/File:Tribulus_terrestris_(Family_Zygophyllaceae).jpg">Wikimedia</a> has a picture for comparision.

The plant in the picture seemed to be of the genus of Tribulus. While researching species known to be present in the Empty Quarter I found <a class="plink" href="http://www.plantdiversityofsaudiarabia.info/Biodiversity-Saudi-Arabia/Vegetation/Deserts%20of%20Saudi%20Arabia.htm">this page</a> by Dr. Jacob Thomas of the department of botany & microbiology of King Saud University in Riyadh. There Tribulus macropterus var. arabicus is the only listed species known to be present in the Empty Quarter. An other domestic species of the same genus in Saudi Arabian deserts is Tribulus pentandrus. However the flowers of that species have a different shape <a class="plink" href="https://eol.org/pages/47111008/media">(pictures in the Encyclopedia of Life)</a>.

Comparing Rebekka's picture with observations in the <a class="plink" href="https://eol.org/pages/52555304">EOL</a> and on <a class="plink" href="https://www.gbif.org/species/5635251">GBIF</a> and taking the website of Dr. Jacobs into account, I am fairly certain, that the plant in the picture can be specified as <span class="highlight">Tribulus macropterus var. arabicus</span>.
